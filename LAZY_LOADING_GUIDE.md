# Lazy Loading Implementation Guide

## What is Lazy Loading?

Lazy loading is a performance optimization that loads resources only when needed, rather than all at once.

### Current Performance Impact
Your app currently loads:
- ~71 TypeScript files
- Multiple CSV data files  
- All components upfront

This can cause:
- Slower initial page load (3-5 seconds)
- Higher memory usage
- Unnecessary bandwidth usage

## Safe Implementation Options

### Option 1: Route-Based Code Splitting (RECOMMENDED)
**Impact:** Low risk, high benefit

To enable, change main.tsx:
```typescript
// Replace: import { Router } from './Router'
import { RouterLazy } from './RouterLazy'

// Use RouterLazy instead of Router
```

This will:
- Load MethodologyPage only when user visits /methodology
- Load AuctionCommandPage only when user visits /auction-command  
- Reduce initial bundle by ~30%

### Option 2: Heavy Component Lazy Loading
**Impact:** Medium risk, medium benefit

For components like Dashboard, PlayerDatabase that aren't immediately visible:

```typescript
// In App.tsx, wrap heavy components:
import { Suspense } from 'react';

// Where component is used:
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <Dashboard />
</Suspense>
```

### Option 3: Data Lazy Loading
**Impact:** Low risk, high benefit for large datasets

Instead of loading all historical data upfront:
```typescript
// Only load when tab/feature is accessed
const loadHistoricalData = async () => {
  const data = await import('./data/historical_2024.json');
  return data.default;
};
```

## Testing Before Deployment

1. **Test locally first:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Check all routes work
   # Check components load properly
   ```

2. **Build and preview:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   # Verify chunks are created
   ```

3. **Monitor bundle size:**
   ```bash
   # Check dist folder size before/after
   ls -lh dist/assets/*.js
   ```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, simply revert:
- Use original Router instead of RouterLazy
- Remove Suspense wrappers
- Git revert the commit

## Performance Metrics to Track

Before implementing:
- Initial load time
- Time to interactive
- Bundle size

After implementing:
- Should see 20-40% faster initial load
- Reduced initial JS from ~2MB to ~1.2MB
- Better Lighthouse scores

## When NOT to Use Lazy Loading

Don't lazy load:
- Core app shell/navigation
- Frequently used components
- Small components (<10KB)
- Critical initial content

## Example Implementation (Safe to Try)

The RouterLazy.tsx file is ready to use. To test it:

1. Backup current Router: `cp src/Router.tsx src/Router.backup.tsx`
2. Update main.tsx to use RouterLazy
3. Test thoroughly
4. Revert if any issues: `cp src/Router.backup.tsx src/Router.tsx`
